						A balloon is a type of aircraft that remains aloft due to its
						buoyancy. A balloon travels by moving with the wind. It is distinct
						from an airship, which is a buoyant aircraft that can be propelled
						through the air in a controlled manner.
					</p>
					<p>There are three main types of balloon aircraft:</p>
					<p>
						Hot air balloons obtain their buoyancy by heating the air inside the
						balloon. They are the most common type of balloon aircraft. "Hot air
						balloon" is sometimes used incorrectly to denote any balloon that
						carries people.
					</p>
					<p>
						Gas balloons are inflated with a gas of lower molecular weight than
						the ambient atmosphere. Most gas balloons operate with the internal
						pressure of the gas being the same as the pressure of the
						surrounding atmosphere.
					</p>

					<p>
						There is a type of gas balloon, called a superpressure balloon, that
						can operate with the lifting gas at pressure that exceeds the
						pressure of the surrounding air, with the objective of limiting or
						eliminating the loss of gas from day-time heating.
					</p>
					<p>Gas balloons are filled with gases such as:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							hydrogen - not widely used for aircraft since the Hindenburg
							disaster because of high flammability (except for some sport
							balloons as well as nearly all unmanned scientific and weather
							balloons).
						</li>
						<li>
							helium - the gas used today for all airships and most manned
							balloons.
						</li>
						<li>
							ammonia - used infrequently due to its caustic qualities and
							limited lift.
						</li>
						<li>
							coal gas - used in the early days of ballooning; it is highly
							flammable.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Rozi√®re balloons use both heated and unheated lifting gases. The
						most common modern use of this type of balloon is for long-distance
						record flights such as the recent circumnavigations.
